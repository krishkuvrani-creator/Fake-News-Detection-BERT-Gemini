# Fake-News-Detection-BERT-Gemini
Fake News Detection using BERT and Gemini AI with Streamlit Interface
This project is a Fake News Detection System built using BERT embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 from SentenceTransformers) and a Logistic Regression classifier.
It also integrates Google Gemini AI for cross-verification and explanation.

Users can paste any news article or headline, and the system will:

  Analyze it using the trained BERT model

  Cross-check with Gemini AI

  Provide a final decision (Fake/Real) with explanation
  The app is built using Streamlit for an interactive UI.

  You need to download the dataset (Fake.csv, True.csv) from the Kaggle link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets
